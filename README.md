Once the dataset was clean, the next step involved exploring the relationships between the variables to better understand the data's structure.

Summary Statistics:
For each drug regimen, summary statistics were generated to examine key metrics such as:

Tumor Volume
Mouse Weight
Number of Observations (Timepoints)
This provides a foundational understanding of the distribution and variance of tumor sizes across different drug regimens.

Capomulin Regimen Focus:
A significant part of the analysis involved exploring the effectiveness of the Capomulin regimen, a drug of particular interest. This regimen was highlighted by:

Tracking the change in tumor volume over time for specific mice.
Comparing the tumor volumes before and after drug administration.

Data visualization is essential for revealing trends and patterns that might not be immediately obvious from summary statistics alone.

Scatter Plot â€“ Mouse Weight vs. Tumor Volume:
To examine the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume, a scatter plot was generated, allowing a visual understanding of how mouse weight correlates with tumor size.

Linear Regression and Correlation:
To quantify this relationship, we performed a linear regression and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient. The linear regression model fits a line to the data, illustrating the trend in the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

Final Plot:
The scatter plot with the fitted linear regression line offers a clear visualization of how tumor volume varies with mouse weight, and whether there are strong correlations in the data.

Next Steps:
Further analysis could involve:

Comparing Different Drug Regimens: Extend the analysis to compare the effects of other drug regimens besides Capomulin, using similar techniques.
Advanced Statistical Analysis: Implementing more complex models, such as multiple regression, to account for other factors influencing tumor volume.
Longitudinal Studies: Investigate the long-term effects of drug regimens over time by analyzing how tumor volume changes across all timepoints for each mouse.
